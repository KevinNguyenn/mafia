[UPDATE: ALPHA VERSION] Based on the projected Alpha milestone goals listed on the App Idea paper, we have implemented many of the features that extend beyond it. We have setup a static/dummy presentation of 6 cards in the showcase screen that is not dependent on the value of the UIPicker and also attached placement images on the 6 cards. 

In the Beta Version, we will establish Core Data management between the cards, establish the dynamic presentation of the cards based on the value of the UIPicker, and create animations upon choosing the cards. We will also modify the presentation of the instructions and game dialogue with animated presentations.

Tentative features will highly be considered during the Final milestone.
