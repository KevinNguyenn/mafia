CS 378 Project

[ALPHA VERSION] Based on the projected Alpha milestone goals listed on the App Idea paper, we have gone beyond these goals by implementing many of the design features that mimick the Mockup Paper. We have setup a static/dummy presentation of 6 cards in the showcase screen that is not dependent on the value of the UIPicker and also attached placement images on the 6 cards. We laid out the foundation of what the app is going to look like, but there is yet to be practical functionality.

In the Beta Version, we will establish Core Data management between the cards, establish the dynamic presentation of the cards based on the value of the UIPicker, create animations upon choosing the cards, and implement the Death Tracker. We will also modify the presentation of the instructions and game dialogue with animations.

Tentative features will more than likely be considered during the Final milestone.

[UPDATE: BETA VERSION] We are still finishing up some of the features for the beta milestone and therefore will be part of the final milestone. What we need to finish is generating the roles for each player, how to end the game, and removing players from the game as it progresses.

The tentative features will not be implemented in the final milestone.
